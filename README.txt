Project Title: Risk Management in Financial Sector Using Artificial Intelligence
Team Members: Agam Srivastava, Prerika, Tejasvi Murmu
Supervisor: Dr. Vaibhav Agarwal, NIT Kurukshetra

Description:
This project applies Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques to detect credit card fraud effectively. Using data preprocessing, SMOTE, LASSO feature selection, and models like XGBoost and CNN, the system achieves high accuracy (up to 99.25%) while minimizing false positives.

Key Contribution:
XGBoost outperforms traditional and ensemble methods in fraud detection without using complex synthetic data generation.
